# Video set speed (video_set_speed)

<!-- sk-doc-template: skill_asset_feature_catalog -->

## 1. OVERVIEW

Changes how fast a video plays, speeding the picture up or slowing it down while the audio tempo follows the same factor. It writes the result as an MP4 file in the export root, in a new numbered folder when subfolder is true, or in the existing folder named by targetFolder, and never changes the input.

The handler is registered in the runtime tool registry. Its published schema is available through media-editor describe video_set_speed. The input must contain a video stream. The speed factor is greater than zero and no more than 100. Common output naming and placement limits are defined in the linked shared entries.

---

## 2. HOW IT WORKS

The schema table lists the required and optional inputs, their limits, defaults, and accepted values. The handler applies any semantic checks noted above before processing. Shared path, placement, result, capability, and process behavior is documented in the [error reference](../shared-tool-behavior/error-codes-and-result-shape.md), [output naming](../shared-tool-behavior/output-naming.md), and [output placement](../shared-tool-behavior/output-placement.md).

### Inputs

| Input | Schema limit | Role |
|---|---|---|
| inputPath | Required string, at least 1 characters | Absolute media path inside an allowed root. |
| outputName | Required string, 1 to 64 characters, pattern `^[^/\\]+$` | Output description. Required for writing tools. 1 to 64 characters, with no slash or backslash. |
| speedFactor | Required number, maximum 100, greater than 0 | Playback speed multiplier. 2 doubles the speed and 0.5 halves it. Use a value greater than 0 and at most 100. |
| fileName | Optional string, 1 to 64 characters, pattern `^[^/\\]+$` | Optional readable file name. 1 to 64 characters, with no slash or backslash. |
| subfolder | Optional boolean | Optional placement flag. true creates a numbered folder. false uses the export root. |
| targetFolder | Optional string, 1 to 80 characters | Optional existing numbered folder. 1 to 80 characters. Cannot pair with subfolder false. |

### Error conditions

The handler does not declare an operation-specific MediaError code.

Operation-specific refusal conditions are summarized in the overview above. Shared path, capability, process, and output failures use the codes in the error reference.
